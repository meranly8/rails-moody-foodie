# Rails Moody Foodie
## About
This Rails web app allows users to sign up, login, login with Google, and logout to keep a food and mood jounral that tracks food and drinks consumed during a day and a user's mood at the end of the day. Users can create, update, and delete their entries and entry provisions, create new provisions for all users to use, view provisions and who they've been consumed by, and view an entry's calorie details. Stretch goals include additional items for daily yes/no tracking, colorful visualizations of daily moods for a month, and other mood analysis.
